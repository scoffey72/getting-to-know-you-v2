            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            
        
            <p>Hi, Im Sean Coffey. I am currently a sophmore here at Lewis.
                 I am double majoring in physics and I will transfer to IIT 
                 for my second degree in mechanial engineering. Outside of 
                 school I work at pilot and am currently looking into coaching
                  for hockey. I have played hockey for 10 years now and would 
                  like to be a goalie coach for my friend's team. I love that kind 
                  of atmosphere. I used to work for the proshop at the ice rink.
                   While in college I live at home with my parents, brother, sister, 
                   and aunt. I have two brothers and two sisters.</p>
            <h2>What I Hope to Learn</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How to become better at python</li>

                <li>Basic coding languages</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
             <p>I have many hobbies. These would include chess, video games, and hockey.
                However, as I mentioned earlier, I absolutly love ice hockey. It has been in my 
                life for the longest time. My fascination for the game kicked off when I saw the 
                 BlackHawkswin the Stanley Cup in 2010. That following summer I started to learn
                 to ice skate. I started off just in a learn to skate then joined my hockey club. 
                 I had started off as a regular skater but soon switched to being a goalie.
                 I stayed with the game and had a lot of fun with it. I definetly miss playing
                and really want to get into coaching. 
          </p>

          <h2>Hockey</h2>
          <p1>it was a large part of my life. I know I mentioned it was my favorite hobby, but it 
            has been a really big part of my life. i distinctly rember my first Hawks game. To keep it brief,
             it was on Valentine's Day in 2009. They played the Dallas Stars and had a landslide victory. They won 6-1.
             It was a great wat to get into the sport and lead me to many other memorable moments.
